<p>CSS has evolved significantly over the years, providing developers with powerful tools to create sophisticated layouts and animations. Understanding these modern techniques is essential for creating professional web applications.</p>

<p>CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex grid-based layouts with ease. It provides precise control over both rows and columns, making it perfect for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.</p>

<p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method that excels at distributing space and aligning items within a container. It's particularly useful for navigation menus, card layouts, and any situation where you need to align items along a single axis.</p>

<p>CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables) have revolutionized how we write and maintain CSS. They allow you to define reusable values that can be updated dynamically, making it easier to create themes, maintain consistency, and implement design systems.</p>
