<p>Testing is an integral part of the software development lifecycle that helps ensure code quality, catch bugs early, and maintain application reliability. A comprehensive testing strategy includes multiple types of tests, each serving a specific purpose in the development process.</p>

<p>Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation. These tests are fast, reliable, and help catch bugs early in development. Use testing frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or Vitest to write and run unit tests. Aim for high test coverage, but remember that quality is more important than quantity.</p>

<p>Integration testing verifies that different parts of your application work together correctly. This includes testing API endpoints, database interactions, and component integration. Integration tests help identify issues that unit tests might miss, such as problems with data flow between components.</p>

<p>End-to-end testing simulates real user interactions with your application. Tools like Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium allow you to test complete user workflows from start to finish. These tests are slower and more fragile than unit tests but provide confidence that your application works as expected from a user's perspective.</p>

<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a development methodology where you write tests before implementing features. This approach helps clarify requirements, improves code design, and ensures that all code is testable. While TDD requires discipline and practice, it can significantly improve code quality and reduce debugging time.</p>
