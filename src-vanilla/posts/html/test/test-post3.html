<p>Good design is not just about aesthetics; it's about creating experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and enjoyable for users. Understanding core design principles is essential for creating web applications that users love to interact with.</p>

<p>Hierarchy is one of the most important design principles. It helps users understand the relationship between different elements on a page and guides their attention to the most important information first. This can be achieved through size, color, contrast, and positioning.</p>

<p>Consistency is another crucial principle that helps users feel comfortable and confident when using your application. Consistent use of colors, typography, spacing, and interaction patterns creates a cohesive experience that feels professional and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Accessibility should never be an afterthought in web design. Ensuring that your applications are usable by people with disabilities is not only a legal requirement in many cases but also makes your products better for everyone. This includes proper color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.</p>
