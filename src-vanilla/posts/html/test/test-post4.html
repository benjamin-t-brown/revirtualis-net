<p>The JavaScript ecosystem has evolved dramatically over the past decade, with numerous frameworks and libraries competing for developer attention. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each can help you make informed decisions for your projects.</p>

<p>React, developed by Facebook, has become one of the most popular frameworks due to its component-based architecture and large ecosystem. Its virtual DOM implementation provides excellent performance, while its declarative syntax makes it easy to understand and maintain code.</p>

<p>Vue.js offers a progressive framework that can be adopted incrementally. It's known for its gentle learning curve and excellent documentation, making it an ideal choice for teams new to modern JavaScript frameworks or for projects that need to be built quickly.</p>

<p>Angular, maintained by Google, provides a comprehensive solution for large-scale applications. It includes built-in tools for routing, state management, and testing, making it suitable for enterprise-level projects that require strict architecture and extensive tooling.</p>
