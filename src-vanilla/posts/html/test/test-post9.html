<p>With mobile devices accounting for over half of web traffic, designing for mobile first is no longer optional. Mobile-first design ensures that your applications provide excellent user experiences across all devices, from smartphones to desktop computers.</p>

<p>CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful tools for creating responsive layouts. CSS Grid excels at two-dimensional layouts, while Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts. Combining these technologies allows you to create complex, responsive designs that adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.</p>

<p>Media queries are essential for applying different styles based on device characteristics. Start with mobile styles as the base and progressively enhance for larger screens. Common breakpoints include 768px for tablets and 1024px for desktop devices, but these should be based on your content rather than specific device sizes.</p>

<p>Touch-friendly design is crucial for mobile applications. Ensure that interactive elements are large enough to be easily tapped (minimum 44px), provide adequate spacing between clickable elements, and consider touch gestures in your interaction design. Test your applications on actual devices to ensure they work well in real-world conditions.</p>
