<p>Database performance is often the bottleneck in web applications. As data grows, queries that once executed quickly can become slow and impact user experience. Understanding optimization strategies is essential for maintaining responsive applications.</p>

<p>Indexing is one of the most effective ways to improve query performance. Proper indexes can reduce query execution time from seconds to milliseconds. However, indexes come with a cost - they consume storage space and slow down write operations. The key is to create indexes that support your most common and critical queries while avoiding over-indexing.</p>

<p>Query optimization involves analyzing and restructuring SQL queries to improve their performance. This includes selecting only necessary columns, using appropriate JOIN types, avoiding subqueries when possible, and leveraging database-specific features like query hints. Understanding the query execution plan is crucial for identifying bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Database normalization and denormalization are two opposing strategies that affect performance. Normalization reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity but can require more complex queries. Denormalization improves query performance by reducing JOINs but increases storage requirements and maintenance complexity. The choice depends on your specific use case and performance requirements.</p>
