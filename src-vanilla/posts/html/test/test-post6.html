<p>Designing a good API is crucial for the success of any web application. A well-designed API should be intuitive, consistent, and easy to use for developers who will integrate with it. Understanding RESTful principles is essential for creating APIs that stand the test of time.</p>

<p>Resource-based URLs are the foundation of RESTful API design. Each endpoint should represent a resource, and the HTTP methods should indicate the action being performed on that resource. For example, GET /users retrieves users, POST /users creates a new user, PUT /users/{id} updates a specific user, and DELETE /users/{id} removes a user.</p>

<p>HTTP status codes play a vital role in API communication. They provide immediate feedback about the success or failure of requests. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error). Using appropriate status codes helps clients handle responses correctly.</p>

<p>Versioning is another critical aspect of API design. As APIs evolve, maintaining backward compatibility becomes challenging. Common versioning strategies include URL versioning (/api/v1/users), header versioning (Accept: application/vnd.api+json;version=1), and query parameter versioning (/api/users?version=1). Each approach has its trade-offs and should be chosen based on your specific requirements.</p>
