<p>Web application security is not optional - it's a fundamental requirement for any application that handles user data or provides critical functionality. Security breaches can result in data loss, financial damage, and loss of user trust. Implementing security best practices from the start is much easier than retrofitting security later.</p>

<p>Authentication and authorization are the foundation of application security. Implement strong password policies, use secure password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2, and consider implementing multi-factor authentication for sensitive applications. Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.</p>

<p>HTTPS is essential for protecting data in transit. Use strong encryption protocols and keep certificates up to date. Implement proper session management with secure, random session tokens and set appropriate expiration times. Consider using HTTP-only cookies for session storage to prevent XSS attacks.</p>

<p>Regular security audits and penetration testing help identify vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. Keep all dependencies updated to patch known security vulnerabilities. Implement proper logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activities and potential security incidents.</p>
