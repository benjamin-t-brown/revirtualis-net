<p>
  I despise writing JSON by hand.  I do it all the time though, especially when setting up data for tests.  There's something about the syntax with double quotes and strict commas and how things are nested that really interrupts my flow as I'm typing.   Usually when I'm writing JSON by hand, I'm creating data, which requires me to be creative and think about what I'm putting in there.  When my thoughts are interrupted, I work very, very slowly.
