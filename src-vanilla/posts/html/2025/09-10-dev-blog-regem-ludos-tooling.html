  I despise writing JSON by hand. I do it all the time though, especially when
  setting up data for tests. There's something about the syntax with double
  quotes and strict commas and how things are nested that really interrupts my
  flow as I'm typing. Usually when I'm writing JSON by hand, I'm creating data,
  which requires me to be creative and think about what I'm putting in there.
  When my thoughts are interrupted, I work very, very slowly.

  Regem Ludos is not created with a game engine.  The advantage of this is that, during development, there is a lot of flexibility with how the game is created, where it runs, and how it works.  One of the many disadvantages of this is that there are no default tools to help build it.
</p>
<p>
  Things asset management for sounds and graphics, build output and debugging, even architecture paradigms like ECS that these engines are built around, all have extensive helpers that ease the process of developing a game.  Something I find really cool is unreal 5's phone app for recording dialog.  Stuff like this truly does save a ton of time during development.  We're talking about years of development here.

  Regem Ludos didn't have any of that cool stuff at the start of development.  Instead, it makes use of some combination the following:
  <li>Open source tooling.</li>
  <li>Custom-created tooling.</li>
  <li>Doing things by hand in the most time consuming way possible.</li>
