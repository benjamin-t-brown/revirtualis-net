<p><img class="blog-image" style="border: 2px solid white" src="/img/post-data/launch.png" alt="screenshot"></img>This is the official launch of the Revirtualis blog!</p>
<p>
  What is Revirtualis? It's a repository of projects, news, and information for
  my games and software. I'm using it to showcase the creative things I do
  regarding coding, art, and music. This isn't a new idea, of course, but it's a
  good one for record keeping purposes and to have a place to point to when
  somebody asks me "what have you been working on?"

  Why <i>Revirtualis</i>? If you translate "virtual reality" as best you can to
  Latin, you might get the phrase "virtualis re". Some reordering gives a
  reasonable approximation of a brand name. I enjoy creating software that
  simulates worlds and I have an affinity for Latin, so it fits well enough.
  It's also the name of a fictional place in the story the upcoming game
  <b>Regem Ludos</b>! More info <a href="/game-info/regem-ludos">RIGHT HERE</a>

  I'm excited for the prospect of adding things to this site as time goes on,
  new posts, other games, improvements and such. Here's to a good kickoff for an
  exciting endeavor! ðŸŽ‰
